# Hellenia
Enter the Hellenian savannah, a wilderness claimed by bandits, and beasts alike. Into this territory the town of Appolis sends its emissaries, tasking them with subduing the lawless folk and deadly creatures that have made it a realm of savagery and shame. Beyond the last rugged frontier stretches the home of voracious monsters and wily natives. Can you survive and bring these dangerous lands to heel? Or will you just be one more fateful band, lost forever to the ravenous wilds?
