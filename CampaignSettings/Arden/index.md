# Arden
The moon of Arden hangs in the void like a blue-green jewel, orbiting a vast silver planet caught between two stars. From its burning poles, to the frozen ring of ice that bisects the planet, Arden is a world of extremes. A world of brave warriors, powerful mages and warring kingdoms, where the cosmic balance of good and evil is put to the test.
