# Equipment

## Lightsaber
* Medium advanced melee weapon. Not normally for sale/no price.
* Must be ignited as an on turn action.
* A lightsaber can slice through any substance short of advanced pretech armor plating, inflicting full normal damage on vehicles, including gravtanks or other targets subject only to Heavy weapons. For Shock purposes, all targets, except those protected by energy shields, are treated as if they were AC 10. Against all targets, the blades have an effective +1 bonus to hit and damage. A single type A cell powers them for months of use. 

### Deflect
A psychic with at least Stab 0 and wielding an ignited lightsaber may attempt to deflect fire from laser weapons targeting them. When doing so they add their lightsaber attack bonus to their AC. 

### Redirect
If a psychic with at least Stab 1 and wielding an ignited lightsaber is missed by an attack that would have hit them without the AC bonus from Deflect, they may make an attack roll as an instant action to redirect the attack.

## Double-bladed Lightsaber
* As lightsaber.
* Can be used for two-weapon-fighting.
