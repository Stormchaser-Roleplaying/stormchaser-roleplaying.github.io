# General House Rules
* Multiple foci, that allow one to roll 3d6 and drop the lowest for the same skill check stack. Each instance of such an ability adds 1d6 to the dice pool and only the highest two are kept.
* When plotting an individual course through empty space, Spike-Drive hex ranges function relative to the squares of the Standard Galactic Grid. Much longer distances can be travelled when using the established hyperlanes.
