# Common Goods
* **Carts** cannot leave the old Roman roads or clear paths, and each need two oxen for pulling. They can carry more or less a hundred items.
* **Cloaks** are worn by nearly all in cold weather and the brooches used to fasten them are ways to show wealth. A fine embroidered cloak grants 1 point of Splendour.
* **Clothes** are costly. Fine clothes grant a Splendour of 1, splendid ones grant 2, and those fashioned of the marvelous silk of Tang grant 4 Splendour. A hero felled in battle will spoil his clothes and need them mended.
* **Common artisan’s tools** are hammers, saws, tongs, vats or other such things sufficient to carry out the ordinary work of a smith, or leatherworker, or other who has a task more complex than simple weaving or hewing.
* **Sacks satchels** are how men carry weights. Without some way to bear a burden a hero may find it cumbersome to haul all his possessions.
