# Splendour
All men understand the meaning of gold and jewels on a warrior’s limbs. Such a hero is one who has been given many gifts by his liege and earned many treasures with his courage. To wear great finery is proof of a man’s courage and prowess, for how else could he have possibly gained such treasures?

This is **Splendour**, the measure of a warrior’s apparent glory. The more magnificent they appear, the greater the impression that they make on their fellow man. This can intimidate and inspire fear, or hearten those who follow them to war to strike courageously in battle.

Splendour is measured in points. Each piece of exceptional equipment or splendid jewelry or fine garb is worth one or more points of Splendour based on its value. The hero decides what they are wearing, totals up the Splendour, and compares it to the table below. Each level allows him to reroll certain low d20 outcomes on Charisma checks.

| Total Splendour | Reroll d20 Result of... |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 0 | None |
| 1-4 | 1 |
| 5-9 | 1-2 |
| 10-14 | 1-3 |
| 15-19 | 1-4 |
| 20 or more | 1-5 |

A reroll may be used to reroll a Charisma (Persuasion) check, Charisma (Intimidation) check, or even a Charisma (Deception) check if the hero's Splendour makes them more believable. In all cases, the better of the two rolls is used. A Splendour reroll may be used only once for any given Charisma check.

A hero may count no more items towards their Splendour score than their total character level. Thus, a novice hero of first level, who has both a beautiful embroidered cloak and a fine sword that he won in battle, receives Splendour from only one of these things, while a grizzled legend of tenth level may benefit from the Splendour of ten different items. The hero must be wearing and displaying the items to gain Splendour from them and it must make sense that he should be wearing or bearing all these things at once. A hero with two tunics or two cloaks wrapped around his chest will be thought only a clown.

> Only use this table if the item itself doesn’t say how much Splendour it’s worth.
