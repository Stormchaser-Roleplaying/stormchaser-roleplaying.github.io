# Weapons
The Dark Ages version of the equipment list is very similar to the standard one, with some omissions (notably, crossbows). Bows are not as widespread as they will become, but they're certainly around in commmon use. Axes are fearsome weapons to intimidate your foes, while spears are the most common weapon you'll encounter, used by everyone from ceorls to kings and even Gods. Spears are a weapon to respect - even the great God Woden favours a spear.

The most common bladed weapon is the seax, a single-edged sword or knife. Ownership of a seax indicates the freedom of the owner. A seax can be an efficient killing tool, having sufficient mass to give weight to a blow (particularly if used in a two-handed grip) and an impressive agility. The langseax provides a reasonable alternative to a proper sweord at reduced cost, needing a lower quality of metal and only one edge to craft and hone.

## Sweords
That said, a true sweord commands respect. A two-edged pattern-welded blade with a finely decorated hilt and pommel, it displays the skills of a master smith. A good sweord is made greater by the deeds of its bearers. Sweords are very valuable and are often handed down from generation to generation, or are received as gifts from great warriors and kings. Only characters with a backstory explaining the blade may begin play with a true sweord. Your sweord should have a name.

### Prestigious
A sweord is not merely a death-dealing weapon, but a potent symbol of leadership, social status and ancestral leadership. A character who carries a sweord commands basic respect from any freefolk, granting advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks at the GM's discretion.
