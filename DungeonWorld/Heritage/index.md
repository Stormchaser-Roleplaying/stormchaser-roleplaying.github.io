# New Mechanic: Heritage
Heritage reflects a character’s background and history, offering many more choices for greater customisation to each game. Please note that while Heritage is a part of each character’s background, it is a separate and distinct mechanic from each playbook’s Background move.

Your choice of race or heritage should ideally bring some creative influence into the conversation. An elven ranger isn’t the same as a human ranger with pointy ears. When you create a new character, decide on your species, ethnicity, and cultural heritage, choosing anything or any combination of things that sounds interesting to you and the other players. Then **choose four Heritage moves** based upon your background. Heritage moves are simple phrases or actions your character can do that reflect your character’s heritage: their ancestry, homeland, culture, or youth.

When you **Spout Lore about your heritage**, you automatically succeed, as if you had rolled a 10+.

Using a Heritage move may allow you to obviate or overcome a Danger that would otherwise need to be Defied, or grant Lore without having to Spout it first. However, they should not be allowed to deal damage without having to roll for it. Using a Heritage move to set up or augment another move may give advantage on that move. Exactly what happens is left to the GM’s discretion.

## Heritage Boxes
Some Heritage moves can only be used sporadically. **Their use is tracked with Heritage boxes.**

**As part of the End of Session move (and when the game begins)**, mark a Heritage box. When you **draw upon your heritage to perform a task**, erase a mark from one of your Heritage boxes and make one of your Heritage moves. No roll is necessary; you just make that move. When you **reveal a downside to your Heritage that creates some meaningful tension or disadvantage for you**, mark a Heritage box. The GM may ask you to Defy Danger or give disadvantage to a move you make that follows when this downside impacts you.

When you Level Up, if you are level 6 or higher, instead of choosing a new move, you may gain a third Heritage box. If you choose this option, you also immediately mark all of your Heritages boxes for free. You may only choose this option once.
