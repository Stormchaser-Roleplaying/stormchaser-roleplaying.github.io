# Revised Bonds
All characters demonstrate foibles and eccentricities which serve to complicate their lives. These are represented by flags. Flags replace Dungeon World’s use of bonds as a method of earning XP through roleplay, inverting their pattern. Instead of bonds connecting your character to other characters, your flags define behaviors that other players enable. By selecting a flag, you signal what sorts of interactions and complications you are looking to explore, giving other players permission and encouragement to complicate your life by incorporating your flag into play.

Flags are phrased as instructions or requests to the other players to treat your character a certain way. As such, the best flags…

…suggest an action specific enough that it is obvious when another character hits it.

…create some sort of conflict or tension, usually by giving your character a choice to make.

…give you an opportunity to demonstrate something about your character that might not otherwise be showcased.

…enable taking action in a way meaningful to your character.

…bring enough consequence to the story to develop a relationship between your character and another.

When another player follows the instruction indicated by your flag, (called “hitting” your flag), the End of Session move (below) will reward them for doing so. This means that players should be aware of the flags of the characters at the table, and think about how they might hit them in play. Note that hitting another player’s flag usually means confronting them with a tough choice that pits their personality against a situation. They may choose to embrace their personality or compromise it for the situation. Either way, just setting up the choice means you hit their flag.

Each character should choose a number of flags equal to 4 + their Charisma modifier. As flags are intended to represent deep-seated personality traits, they tend to resist change. However, if it makes sense to drop a flag and/or gain a new one, they may be changed as part of the End of Session move.

## *Revised Move*: End of Session
When you **reach the end of a session**, if you hit a flag of any other character during the session at least once, mark XP. If anyone hit at least one of your flags this session, mark XP. Additionally, choose any bonds or flags that you feel are no longer valid or relevant and replace them with new ones.

Next, look at your drive. If you fulfilled your drive at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:
* Did we learn something new and important?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.
