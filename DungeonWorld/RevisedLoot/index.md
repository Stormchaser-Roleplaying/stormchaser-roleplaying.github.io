# Revised Loot and a Tag-Based Economy
No longer do you have to count every coin spent or track every arrow used. The bulk of the player characters’ equipment is replaced with a single resource called Supplies. Treasure discovered is not tracked in value of coins but by a tag associated with that type of loot.

## New Tags for Treasure
Loot is no longer measured in valuation of coins. Instead, pieces of loot are assigned a tag, stating roughly how much they are worth. There are four tags which describe loot, in order of increasing value: *shiny*, *valuable*, *precious*, and *priceless*.

The precise exchange rates between tags is imprecise and variable, but in general, a *valuable* piece of loot is worth 3-5 *shiny* pieces of loot, and a *precious* piece of loot is worth 3-5 *valuable* pieces of loot. *Priceless* loot is just that, it can’t be traded for and it is very difficult to exchange for coin.

Some types of loot like sacks of coins can be divvied up; others, like objects of art, need to be fenced. This may present further complications; small villages will be unlikely to have the resources to exchange a *precious* work of art for useable coin.

### A *shiny* piece of loot is enough for...

…A handful of coins

…A pretty trinket or bauble

…A night at a poor-quality inn for the party—two nights if you don't mind the floor of the common room, or a week for just you

…A bag of Supplies (3 uses, 1 weight)

…A common weapon

…A shield (+1 armor, 2 weight)

…A suit of leather armor (1 armor, 1 weight)

…A week’s wages of unskilled labor

…A dose of antitoxin

…Medical attention from an apprentice priest or surgeon

### A *valuable* piece of loot is enough for...

…A purse of coins (1 weight)

…A shipment of trade goods, enough to fill a small cart

…A fine gem or a handful of semi-precious gemstones

…A week's stay at an inn for the party, or a month for yourself

…A bag of Supplies for every member of the party

…A quality weapon (add one of *precise*, *forceful*, *far*, 1 piercing, or +1 damage)

…A horse and cart

…A riding horse with saddle

…A suit of chainmail (2 armor, clumsy, 3 weight)

…A healing potion

…A night of feasting, strong drink, and entertainment

…A week’s wages of skilled labor

…A fine musical instrument

…A holy relic of moderate importance

…Some arcane materials (scrolls, crystals, enchanted candles)

…Medical care from a skilled priest or surgeon

### A *precious* piece of loot is enough for...

…A chest of coins (3 weight)

…A work of fine art, jewelry or similar relic, like a crown

…People to notice and start talking when you’re waving around that kind of wealth; expect stories about how you looted this

…Knowledge that people will kill for

…A month's stay at a upscale inn for the party, including meals, or a season for just yourself

…A small cottage for yourself or a simple workshop

…A small ship, single-masted and seaworthy but little more

…A trained warhorse, complete with barding

…A suit of plate armor (3 armor, clumsy, 4 weight) or similar custom work of quality craftsmanship by a trained professional

…A holy relic of exceptional importance

### A *priceless* piece of loot is enough for…

…An entire treasure horde

…A truly legendary artifact or piece of art

…Weapons and armor to outfit a small army

…Knowledge that could shift the balance of power in the land

…A fine house or manor, including lands

…Someone to start or buy a major business establishment for themselves, like an fine-quality inn or guildhouse

…A large merchant ship or galley, capable of carrying a lot

…A year of living in luxury for the entire party or several years for just you

…Some serious attention drawn your way; just talking about it will get even kings and nobles’ eyeing you

…Most adventurers to seriously consider retirement

## Random Treasure
Roll the monster’s damage plus any added dice to find the monster’s treasure:
1. Some mundane items useful to the current situation (1d6-3 uses of Supplies, minimum 1 use)
2. A pretty trinket or bauble (*shiny*, 1 weight)
3. A few coins (*shiny*, 0 weight)
4. A purse of coins (*valuable*, 1 weight)
5. A small item (gem, art) of considerable value (*valuable*, 0 weight)
6. Some minor magical trinket (*valuable*, weight varies)
7. Useful information (in the form of clues, notes, etc.)
8. A chest of coins and other small valuables (*precious*, 3 weight)
9. A very valuable small item (gem, art) (*precious*, 0 weight)
10. A magical item or magical effect (*precious*, weight varies)
11. 1d4 bags of coins (*precious*, 2 weight)
12. A sign of office (crown, banner) (*precious*, 2 weight)
13. A large art item (*precious*, 1 weight, fragile)
14. A unique item (*priceless*, weight varies)
15. All the information needed to learn a new spell and roll again
16. A portal or secret path (or directions to one) and roll again
17. Something relating to one of the characters and roll again
18. A hoard (*priceless*, 2d6 weight), which also contains 1d6 additional rolls (ignore future 19+ results)

## *New Item*: Supplies (3 uses, 1 weight)
Supplies are a catch-all resource for any type of useful gear that an adventurer might carry in their pack, including food, water, bandages, and arrows. Supplies are similar to adventuring gear, but their utility encompasses additional purposes.

One use of Supplies is…

…Enough food to feed everyone in the party for one day’s travel or one instance of Making Camp

…A use of adventuring gear or something worth a few coins

…Some extra arrows (c.f. Volley), a throwing knife, or a dagger

…Healing supplies for the First Aid move (see below)

When you **search your pack for something useful and spend 1 use of Supplies**, you produce a common, mundane item, something that you could have conceivably been carrying. Add the item to your inventory.

At the GM’s option, Supplies may have additional properties, limitations, or utility, based upon fictional circumstances. For example, Supplies bought in a Dirt-poor steading may have only very crude or simple uses, or if your pack has been soaked with sewage, you can’t produce food from your Supplies anymore.

## *New Move*: First Aid
When you spend a few minutes tending to someone’s injuries, spend 1 use of Supplies and choose one:
* They recover 1d6+your INT HP. If the die shows a 1, the GM will introduce an additional complication from the injury. If your patient has recently been hit by a messy attack, there is a complication if the die shows a 1 or a 2.
* You stabilise any dangerous wounds they have. Roll 1d6; if the die shows a 1 or a 2, there's a complication.
