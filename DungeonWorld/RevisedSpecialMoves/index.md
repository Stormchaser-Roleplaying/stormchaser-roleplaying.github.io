# Revised Special Moves
If a special move is not listed here, assume it is unchanged from core Dungeon World.

## Carouse
When you **return triumphant and throw a big party**, spend a valuable item and roll +1 for every additional valuable item spent. *On a 10+, choose three. *On a 7-9, choose two. *On a 6-, choose one anyway, but things get really out of hand, the GM will say how.
* You befriend a useful NPC.
* You hear rumors of an opportunity.
* You gain useful information.
* You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.

## I Know a Guy
When you know someone who can help, name them and roll +CHA. On a 10+, yeah, sure, they can help, though you might need to make it worth their while. On a 7-9, pick 1:
* They can help, but they need your help first.
* They're going to ask for a lot.
* They're not quite cut out for this.
* You can't exactly trust them.

On a 6-, the GM picks 1 and then some.

## Make Camp/End of Session
When you **settle in to rest in a dangerous area**, someone in the party must expend 1 use of Supplies. 

Then, answer these three questions as a group:
* Did we learn something new and important?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?

Then, take turns with the following:
* Give an example of how you’ve met your Drive’s requirement; if you can, mark XP.
* If you hit a flag of any other PC during the session at least once, mark XP.
* If any PC hit at least one of your flags this session, mark XP.
* Choose any bonds or flags that you feel are no longer valid or relevant and replace them with new ones.   

For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

When you **wake from at least a few hours sleep**, you regain HP equal to half your maximum.

## Raid
When you **plan an attack on a place**, describe your approach and your primary objective, then whoever made the plan rolls…
* +1 if you exploit a known weakness or vulnerability in your target
* +1 if you have allies to coordinate your attack with or someone on the inside
* +1 if you have detailed knowledge of the terrain, either from a map or a scouting report
* +1 if you have the drop on them or the element of surprise on your side

*On a 10+, choose two. *On a 7-9, choose one:
* You have the initiative; your enemies are either caught off-guard, demoralized, or in disarray
* You have seized some tactical advantage that gives you the upper hand in the fight, the GM will tell you what
* There are no unexpected complications present

*On a 6-, your plan has gone awry; the GM will describe the scene with you already at a disadvantage or in a desperate situation.

The GM will describe the starting point of the action as the battle is joined or as your main forces breach the perimeter, based on your roll and options chosen. They will also ask some establishing questions as to what happened and present you with the opportunity to act.

> Raid is a move to get into the action quickly without getting bogged down in excessive planning or coordination.

## Recruit
When you **go looking to hire help**, tell the GM what you're offering and whom you're looking for, phrased in one of the following ways:
* A group of ______ (porters, guards, minstrels, angry farmers, etc.)
* A skilled ______ (guide, sage, burglar, bodyguard, etc.)

A group is a follower like any other, but with the *group* tag. If the GM says that you can't find that kind of help in a place like this, start over or move on. Otherwise, roll+nothing. If you have a good reputation in these parts, or if you're willing to throw around some money (the GM will tell you how much), roll with advantage. *On a hit, you find someone suitable. *On a 7-9, choose one, the GM will provide the details:
* They demand greater compensation, in coin or some other form.
* No one here fits the bill, but you hear of someone elsewhere who does.
* They have a need that must be met first (permission from someone else, a favour, etc.)
* You can tell at a glance they are less than ideal (ask the GM how).

In general, the players can tell the GM what they want their followers to do and expect that they will do it. Unless otherwise noted, they don't make any of the basic moves. Instead, use these moves:

### Call for Assistance
When **a follower helps you make a move that calls for a roll**, you gain advantage for that roll, but they will be exposed to any potential consequences.

When **a follower helps you Hack and Slash or Volley**, your damage roll gets advantage, and add any damage bonuses the follower has on top of that.

When **a follower helps you Defend**, you can spend 1 hold to redirect an attack to them instead of yourself.

### Do Their Thing
When **a follower does something chancy within the scope of their tags or moves**, roll+Quality. *On a 10+, they do it, as well as one could reasonably hope. *On a 7-9, they do it, but there’s a cost, consequence, or limitation; the GM will say what. When a follower does something chancy that falls beyond the scope of their tags or moves, or does anything on their own, the GM will simply tell you what happens. No roll is made.

### Order Follower
When you **order or expect a follower to do something dangerous, degrading, or contrary to their Instinct**, roll+Loyalty. *On a 10+, they do it, to the best of their ability. *On a 7-9, they do it, but choose one:
* Decrease the follower’s Loyalty by 1
* They complain loudly, now or later, and demand something in return
* Caution, laziness, or fear makes them take a long time to do it
* They do a poor job of it, shoddy or half-hearted
