# Travel and Exploration Moves

## Forage
When you spend a day seeking food in the wild, and your surroundings are not Barren, roll +WIS. *On a 10+, you gain 1d4 rations, +1d4 rations if you have the knowledge and gear needed to trap or hunt. On a 7-9, as above, but first face a Discovery or Danger of the GMâ€™s choice.

## Forge Ahead
When you push on despite powerful opposition from the elements, roll +CON. *On a 10+, you go as far as you are able before needing to pause for a rest. *On a 7-9, choose 1 from the list below.
* You go as far as you are able, but overtax yourself and become weak, shaky, or sick (choose one).
* You go as far as you are able, but the weather takes its deepest toll on your gear (ask the GM how).
* On second thought, maybe you're better off staying put. If you make progress, ask the GM where you end up on the map, and if the weather shows any sign of relenting.

## Journey
When you **travel by a safe route**, indicate your destination on the map. The GM will tell you how long the trip takes, and what (if anything) happens along the way. Consume 1 use of supplies for each day spent on the road.

## Scout Ahead
When you **take point and look for anything out of the ordinary**, roll +WIS. *On a 10+, choose 2 from the list below. *On a 7-9, choose 1 from the list below.
* You get the drop on whatever lies ahead.
* You discern a beneficial aspect of the terrain, e.g. a shortcut, shelter, or tactical advantage (describe it).
* You make a Discovery (ask the GM).
* You notice signs of a nearby Danger. As the GM what it is and what it might signify.

## Undertake a Perilous Journey
When you **Undertake a Perilous Journey through the Wilderness**, as a group, spend 1 use of Supplies for each day of travel, then whoever is leading the way rolls+WIS. *On a hit, choose a benefit from this list:
* You travel stealthily, evading or getting the drop on a threat, either on the path or at your destination
* You discover an interesting or useful place or landmark, tell us what you found and add it to the map
* You notice a sign of a nearby threat; ask the GM what it is, and what it might signify
* It takes less time than you expected, the GM will tell you how much time you saved (this does not affect consumption of Supplies)
* You either manage your provisions well or find food in the wild: tell us how. The GM will say how many Supplies you recover.

*On a 7-9, the GM also chooses a trouble from this list as well, but their choice cannot contradict yours:
* It takes you longer than you expected
* You'll need to spend some extra Supplies
* Something is following you
* A danger on the path strikes
* An unwelcome truth awaits you at your destination

*On a 6-, your trip is interrupted by an obstacle, danger, or crisis. After you resolve any troubles that arise, the current leg of your journey is considered complete.
