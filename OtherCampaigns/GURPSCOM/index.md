# GURPS-COM
Hello Commander,

in light of the recent extraterrestrial incursion, this council of nations has convened to approve the activation of the XCOM Project. You have been chosen to lead this initiative. To oversee our first... and last line of defence. Your efforts will have considerable influence on this planet's future. We urge you to keep that in mind as you proceed.

Good luck, Commander.
