# The Pythia Concord
*"I carry a torch in one hand, and a bucket of water in the other. With these things I will set fire to heaven and put out the flames of hell, so that voyagers to God can rip the veils and see the real goal."*

The Pythia Concord is made up of those Kindred who seek ancient knowledge, guarded secrets, ineffable auguries and the power that they all hold. With the namesake of one of the most ancient oracles, the Concord works to amass a wealth of knowledge that would make the library of Alexandria look like a stack of magazines on a coffee table. This collection does not reside in a single location, but is dispersed across the members of the Concord. When assembled, they create the Delphi Archive, the largest compendium of knowledge that the world will ever know.

The Pythia Concord seek to learn of the world without changing it, without the violent narcissism of the Ordo Dracul, or the vulgar zealotry of the Lancea et Sanctum. They woud would rather be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind than the ruler of a kingdom of ash. Thus, they often find themselves working in tandem with the Circle of the Crone and the Carthian Movement.

The Concord considers the former to hold truth in their traditions and lifestyles, though it is stifled by a reckless abandon that inhibits the Circle's understanding of their achievements. The latter seek to change the world by burning it down and erecting a new one, a path that history has demonstrated to end with a pyrrhic victory at best. Nevertheless, in tearing apart the old, something new is often discovered. The Invictus find the Pythia Concord's unwillingness to use the Delphi Archive to seize power on a massive scale profoundly offensive, but employ members of the Concord when they find their own operatives and intelligence insufficient.

Considering the nature of the Pythia Concord's mission, their members endeavour to blend in, recording information while those providing it are none the wiser.
