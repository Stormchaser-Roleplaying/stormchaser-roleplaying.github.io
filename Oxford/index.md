# Oxford By Night
Safe behind the old stone walls of the Oxfordian colleges and drifting silently amidst the catacombs beneath the city's streets, the ever-present influence of the vampiric clans lurks. Installed inside the university since its founding, each maintains the respectable fa√ßade of a college name, all the while pursuing its own unknowable agenda. Some more actively than others.

The city of Oxford lies centrally within Britain - or Avalon, as the kindred know it - at a point of confluence between their many baronies.  To the north and east lie the Ventrue controlled fiefs of Lincoln and London. The Daeva reign over the barony of Winchester to the south and, to the west, Gloucester is the domain of the Malkovian clan. This grants Oxford a special status amongst the kindred, being the closest thing to neutral ground found upon the island, and is the reason why every clan maintains a presence in the city.
