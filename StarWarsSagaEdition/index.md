# Stormchaser's House Rules for *Star Wars Saga Edition*

## Heroic Classes

### Talents
Most talents that can be taken multiple times for cumulative effect must only be taken once and grant the bonus once for every talent of their tree the character possesses.
- Armoured Defence and Improved Armoured Defence have been removed, since armour now provides DR instead of reflex defence.
- Armour Mastery, Juggernaught and Second Skin now have no prerequisite talent.
- Block and Deflect are unified into one talent and are a level 1 Jedi class feature.
- The bomb thrower talent may produce any throwable explosive given sufficient scrap value (half purchase cost).
- Battle Analysis has been removed and is no longer a prerequisite for other talents.
- Redirect shot is a level 3 Jedi class feature, but retains its prerequisite of BAB+5.
- Sneak Attack grants 1d6 of bonus damage per 2 levels of classes with access to the misfortune talent tree (round up), but it does not apply to area attacks.

#### Followers
Followers obtained via talents are issued instructions using the same action economy described in the "Droid as Equipment" section of the Scavenger's Guide to Droids (page 35):

###### Droid/Follower Actions

| Drod/Follower Action Cost | Player Action Cost |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------|
| Free | 1 Free Action |
| Swift | 1 Swift Action |
| Swift x2 | 1 Swift Action |
| Swift x3 | 2 Swift Actions (once per turn) |
| Move | 1 Swift Action (twice per turn) |
| Standard | 1 Swift Action (once per turn) |
| Full-Round Action | 2 Swift Actions (once per turn) |

The base talent granting followers grants one follower per tree talent, to a max of three.

## Skills
* The skills Climb, Jump and Swim are combined into one skill named Athletics.
* The Ride skill and its applications are considered to be covered by the Acrobatics skill.
* When a skill is used to target a defence, roll: <center><strong>1d20+level+stat</strong></center> and subtract 5 if not proficient or add 1 if the character has skill focus.

## Feats
- Double attack and triple attack are free once the prerequisite BAB is fulfilled.
- The Force Training feat provides: <center><strong>1 + your Wisdom modifier</strong></center> in powers known and also expands the number of Force powers that you can use per meditation by: <center><strong>1 + your Wisdom modifier</strong>.</center> Force powers may be used repeatedly and must not be learned multiple times.
- Starship Tactics is based on int instead of wis.
- Weapon Finesse is free to all characters.
- When using Vehicular Combat, the DC of the skill check is equal to the result of the attack roll that you wish to negate and you take a cumulative -5 penalty on your Pilot check every time you have used Vehicular Combat since the beginning of your last turn.

### Droid Programmer
You are trained to program (and reprogram) droids.<br>
*Prerequisites:* Tech Specialist, trained in the Use Computer skill.<br>
*Benefit:* You can program heroic droids with a heuristic processor. The droid's level may not exceed the programmer's own level -2. Programming a heroic droid requires a Use Computer check of: <center><strong>DC = 20 + the droid's level</strong></center> and requires a number of days equal to twice the number of levels added to the droid. This time may be halved by increasing the check DC by five.

## Equipment
Armour now grants a bonus to DR instead of to reflex defence.

## Combat
* Grapples are determined using opposed acrobatics and/or athletics checks.
* **Full Attack:** As a Full-Round Action, you can *move up to your speed and* make more than one attack. To gain extra attacks, you must be wielding two weapons, wielding a double weapon, or using a special ability that grants extra attacks. When making multiple attacks, you may resolve your attacks in any order desired, declaring the target of each attack immediately before making the attack roll. Extra attacks granted from different sources are cumulative. Any penalties associated with gaining an extra attack apply to all attacks that the character makes until the start of their next turn.

## Droids

### Crafting
* A character trained in use computer may program non-heroic droids with a basic processor. The droid's level may not exceed the programmer's own level -2. Programming a non-heroic droid requires a Use Computer check of: <center><strong>DC = 10 + the droid's level</strong></center> and requires a number of days of work equal to the droid's level. This time may be halved by increasing the check DC by five.
* Droids can have their base stats upgraded by +1 at a cost of 500 cr, capped at 18 before racial modifiers or ASIs.
